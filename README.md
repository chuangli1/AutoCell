Users can remotely control the experimental platform through the network. Due to the task-driven model of the project, it is convenient for users In each process of cell culture, the project has the concept of multi-person collaborative work, and users can form a team for scientific research projects. The development language of the server of this project is Python, and the database used is MySQL. The client is built using Vue and TypeScript.
